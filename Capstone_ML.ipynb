    "The goal of this final component of my capstone is to apply what I have discovered thus far in my project and apply it to build a predictive model using tools from sci-kit learn. I will build and evaluate several models, then try to establish a deeper understanding of my model's strengths and weaknesses as well as the real-world applications of my results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work thus far\n",
    "I started this project with my data wrangling component, where I assembled a DataFrame consisting of 13k rows, each one representing a county in a particular year across a four year period (2011-2015) with a target variable. The target variable is a number corresponding to a category for \"residential fixed Internet access connections per 1,000 households by county for both service over 200 kbps in at least one direction and service at least 10 Mbps down / 1 Mbps up.\". This is the BSC, or broadband subscription category. The categories are listed as follows, with x representing connections per 1,000 households:\n",
    "* 0: Zero \n",
    "* 1: Zero < x <= 200 \n",
    "* 2: 200 < x <= 400 \n",
    "* 3: 400 < x <= 600 \n",
    "* 4: 600 < x <= 800 \n",
    "* 5: 800 < x\n",
    "\n",
    "I then populated this DataFrame further with various features pulled from the census API and other sources to complete my DataWrangling component. In my Data Storytelling and Inferential Statistics modules, I examined the data and found 1) that BSC did move upward over the study period and 2) that economic factors were the most closely correlated to BSC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final module, I will build on those previous units to construct a predictive model. Though I am technically predicting for a category, the category is essentially bins for numerical data, so regression models will be used in this case."

    "What is interesting in comparing these two methods of feature engineering is which features were selected in each case. Ridge regression operates in a regularized manner, so that the features initially observed to be highly correlated with the target variable do not always end up having significant coefficients since the model is assessed and built in a totally different way. In contrast, RFE selects features that are less surprising given my findings in examing correlations between features and the target. "

    "### Random Forest Regression\n",
    "Random Forest models are one of the popular and effective applications of machine learning for prediction. They are ensemble methods, building a multitude (a \"forest\") of if/then decision trees on randomized subsets of the data. This ensemble approach is superior to a single decision tree, which has a strong tendency to overfit. However, when many decision trees are created and averaged out, it creates a very powerful model with less of an overfitting tendency. They can be used for classification, or for regression as they are used here. One definite advantage of a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) in this case, though more often seen as a limitation, is that it will only predict values that it has encountered previously. Since we are predicting for a fixed 0-5 range and all those values are encountered in the data, this actually eliminates the need to place a ceiling on predictions as I did for the linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I will user a parameter grid and GridSearchCV() to select the best hyperparameters for the RandomForest."

    "The grid search reveals two things. Increasing the size of my Random Forest will always yield better results, but the rate of return for more estimators decreases rapidly, while the time to run computations increases. By isolating scores from the best performing \"max_features\" method producing the plot below, I can identify an \"elbow\" point at n_features = 40. While this is not the best parameter overall, it works well when computation time is taken into account. In fact, when RMSE is calculated it performs better than any of the linear models! "

    "One useful improvement was segmenting the data based on its real-world origins. Each record is a county in a particular year, and we are trying to predict based on various demographic factors collected by the census bureau. In order to improve RMSE here, I segmented the data into three distinct DataFrames representing rural, semirural, and urban counties and trained a RFR model with previously identified optimal hyper-parameters on each (based on definitions from the Census Bureau). I did this because the various features operate differently at different levels of rurality, for example I discovered that income matters much less as rurality increases. The result is better trained models that produce lower RMSE scores overall."

    "There is a lot to unpack here. Overall, I can predict urban and semirural counties fairly well and better than when the model is trained on the entire dataset. Urban counties in particular have an RMSE of .45, meaning that the average prediction is only off by .45. Considering that urban counties are the most numerous, this is good news. However, the more rural the county is, generally the worse off the model gets at predicting BSC."

Reflecting again on the real-world origins and goals of this project, it is very useful to examine the residuals of the prediction since they show which counties would be best for further expansion by telecom companies. A histogram of the residuals (actual - predicted) is below."

Put simply, red counties are overpredicted, and blue counties are underpredicted.\n",

It should be noted that they are results from the generalized linear regression model rather than the segmented models from the \"Further Optimization\" section, but they still provide us, and telecom companies that are the theoretical consumers of this project, useful information. For example, it looks like in the most recent map that Arkansas, Mississippi and Lousiana in the south are the most underserved and could benefit from market expansion.

    "This project has successfully provided a predictive model for BSC, achieving an RMSE of .57 in the generalized model and as low as .45 for subsets of the data. Data was collected from a variety of sources, cleaned, and arranged. EDA was undertaken to determine general patterns in the data, as well as discovery of highly correlated features. In this final unit, a predictive linear regression model was built, simplified in two different ways, and used to produce a valuable map of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research could be undertaken to understand the high variance and poor predictability of in rural counties. Development of a feature that performs particularly well in rural counties would be very valuable in reducing overall RMSE. Additionally, spatial interpolation techniques could be used to improve accuracy of the predictions even further. I may return to this project in the future to do that, but will leave it for now."
